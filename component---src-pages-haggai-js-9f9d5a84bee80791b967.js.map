Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the\n      prophet, saying, Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses,\n      and this house lie waste? Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts;\n      Consider your ways. Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye\n      have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe\n      you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to\n      put it into a bag with holes. Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your\n      ways. Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I\n      will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD. Ye\n      looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home,\n      I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of mine house\n      that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house. Therefore the\n      heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her\n      fruit. And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains,\n      and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that\n      which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon\n      all the labour of the hands. Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and\n      Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the\n      people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai\n      the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear\n      before the LORD. Then spake Haggai the LORD'S messenger in the LORD'S\n      message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD. And the\n      LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of\n      Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and\n      the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in\n      the house of the LORD of hosts, their God, In the four and twentieth day\n      of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king. In the seventh\n      month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the\n      LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying, Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of\n      Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high\n      priest, and to the residue of the people, saying, Who is left among you\n      that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it\n      not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing? Yet now be strong, O\n      Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the\n      high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and\n      work: for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts: According to the word\n      that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit\n      remaineth among you: fear ye not. For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet\n      once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth,\n      and the sea, and the dry land; And I will shake all nations, and the\n      desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory,\n      saith the LORD of hosts. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith\n      the LORD of hosts. The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of\n      the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace,\n      saith the LORD of hosts. In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month,\n      in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the\n      prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests\n      concerning the law, saying, If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his\n      garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil,\n      or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No. Then\n      said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these,\n      shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be\n      unclean. Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this\n      nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and\n      that which they offer there is unclean. And now, I pray you, consider from\n      this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the\n      temple of the LORD: Since those days were, when one came to an heap of\n      twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to\n      draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty. I smote\n      you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your\n      hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the LORD. Consider now from this day\n      and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from\n      the day that the foundation of the LORD'S temple was laid, consider it. Is\n      the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the\n      pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from this day\n      will I bless you. And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the\n      four and twentieth day of the month, saying, Speak to Zerubbabel, governor\n      of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth; And I will\n      overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the\n      kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that\n      ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one\n      by the sword of his brother. In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I\n      take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD,\n      and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of\n      hosts.\n    </p>\n  </Book_layout>\n)\n\nexport default Haggai\n","import React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\"\nimport \"../css/header.css\"\nimport { Link, withPrefix  } from \"gatsby\"\n\nconst Header = ({ book_title, dll_txt }) => {\n  var [light_mode, set_light_mode] = useState(true)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    var p = document.getElementsByTagName(\"p\")\n    var q = document.getElementsByTagName(\"q\")\n    var h1 = document.getElementsByTagName(\"h1\")[0]\n    var body = document.getElementsByTagName(\"body\")[0]\n    var svg = document.getElementsByTagName(\"svg\")\n    var nav = document.getElementsByClassName(\"nav_bar\")[0]\n    if (light_mode) {\n      nav.style.background = \"white\"\n      body.style.background = \"white\"\n      h1.style.color = \"#222\"\n      for (let v of p) {\n        v.style.color = \"#222\"\n      }\n      for (let v of q) {\n        v.style.color = \"#222\"\n        v.style.borderBottom = \"1px dotted #222\"\n      }\n      for (let v of svg) {\n        v.setAttribute(\"fill\", \"#222\")\n      }\n    } else {\n      nav.style.background = \"#212121\"\n      body.style.background = \"#212121\"\n      h1.style.color = \"#e0e0e0\"\n      for (let v of p) {\n        v.style.color = \"#e0e0e0\"\n      }\n      for (let v of q) {\n        v.style.color = \"#e0e0e0\"\n        v.style.borderBottom = \"1px dotted #e0e0e0\"\n      }\n      for (let v of svg) {\n        v.setAttribute(\"fill\", \"#e0e0e0\")\n      }\n    }\n  }, [light_mode])\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"nav_bar\">\n      <div className=\"nav_group\">\n        <Link to=\"/\">\n          <svg\n            width=\"1.5em\"\n            height=\"1.5em\"\n            viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\n            class=\"bi bi-house-door\"\n            fill=\"currentColor\"\n            xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n          >\n            <path\n              fill-rule=\"evenodd\"\n              d=\"M7.646 1.146a.5.5 0 0 1 .708 0l6 6a.5.5 0 0 1 .146.354v7a.5.5 0 0 1-.5.5H9.5a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5v-4H7v4a.5.5 0 0 1-.5.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5v-7a.5.5 0 0 1 .146-.354l6-6zM2.5 7.707V14H6v-4a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h3a.5.5 0 0 1 .5.5v4h3.5V7.707L8 2.207l-5.5 5.5z\"\n            />\n            <path\n              fill-rule=\"evenodd\"\n              d=\"M13 2.5V6l-2-2V2.5a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h1a.5.5 0 0 1 .5.5z\"\n            />\n          </svg>\n        </Link>\n      </div>\n      <h1>{book_title}</h1>\n\n      <div className=\"nav_group\">\n        <svg\n          onClick={() => set_light_mode(!light_mode)}\n          width=\"1.5em\"\n          height=\"1.5em\"\n          viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\n          className=\"bi bi-lightning\"\n          fill=\"currentColor\"\n          xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n        >\n          <path\n            fillRule=\"evenodd\"\n            d=\"M11.251.068a.5.5 0 0 1 .227.58L9.677 6.5H13a.5.5 0 0 1 .364.843l-8 8.5a.5.5 0 0 1-.842-.49L6.323 9.5H3a.5.5 0 0 1-.364-.843l8-8.5a.5.5 0 0 1 .615-.09zM4.157 8.5H7a.5.5 0 0 1 .478.647L6.11 13.59l5.732-6.09H9a.5.5 0 0 1-.478-.647L9.89 2.41 4.157 8.5z\"\n          />\n        </svg>\n\n        <a href={withPrefix(\"/\") + \"/bible_txt/\" + dll_txt} download={dll_txt}>\n          <svg\n            width=\"1.5em\"\n            height=\"1.5em\"\n            viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\n            class=\"bi bi-file-earmark-arrow-down\"\n            fill=\"currentColor\"\n            xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n          >\n            <path d=\"M4 0h5.5v1H4a1 1 0 0 0-1 1v12a1 1 0 0 0 1 1h8a1 1 0 0 0 1-1V4.5h1V14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V2a2 2 0 0 1 2-2z\" />\n            <path d=\"M9.5 3V0L14 4.5h-3A1.5 1.5 0 0 1 9.5 3z\" />\n            <path\n              fill-rule=\"evenodd\"\n              d=\"M8 6a.5.5 0 0 1 .5.5v3.793l1.146-1.147a.5.5 0 0 1 .708.708l-2 2a.5.5 0 0 1-.708 0l-2-2a.5.5 0 1 1 .708-.708L7.5 10.293V6.5A.5.5 0 0 1 8 6z\"\n            />\n          </svg>\n        </a>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Header\n","/**\n * Layout component that queries for data\n * with Gatsby's useStaticQuery component\n *\n * See: https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/use-static-query/\n */\n\nimport React from \"react\"\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\"\nimport Header from \"./header\"\nimport \"../css/book_layout.css\"\n\nconst Book_layout = ({ children, book_title, dll_txt }) => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"book\">\n      <Header dll_txt={dll_txt} book_title={book_title} />\n      <main>{children}</main>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nBook_layout.propTypes = {\n  children: PropTypes.node.isRequired,\n}\n\nexport default Book_layout\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
