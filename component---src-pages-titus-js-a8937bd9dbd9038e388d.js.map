For\n      this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the\n      things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had\n      appointed thee: If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having\n      faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. For a bishop must be\n      blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not\n      given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; But a lover of\n      hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate; Holding\n      fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by\n      sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. For there\n      are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the\n      circumcision: Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses,\n      teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake. One of\n      themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway\n      liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke\n      them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; Not giving heed to\n      Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth. Unto the\n      pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving\n      is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled. They\n      profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable,\n      and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate. But speak thou the\n      things which become sound doctrine: That the aged men be sober, grave,\n      temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. The aged women\n      likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false\n      accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; That they may\n      teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their\n      children, To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their\n      own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. Young men likewise\n      exhort to be sober minded. In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good\n      works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, Sound\n      speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may\n      be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you. Exhort servants to be\n      obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things;\n      not answering again; Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that\n      they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. For the\n      grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us\n      that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,\n      righteously, and godly, in this present world; Looking for that blessed\n      hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus\n      Christ; Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all\n      iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good\n      works. These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let\n      no man despise thee. Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and\n      powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, To speak evil\n      of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all\n      men. For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived,\n      serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful,\n      and hating one another. But after that the kindness and love of God our\n      Saviour toward man appeared, Not by works of righteousness which we have\n      done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of\n      regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; Which he shed on us\n      abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; That being justified by his\n      grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. This\n      is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly,\n      that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good\n      works. These things are good and profitable unto men. But avoid foolish\n      questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law;\n      for they are unprofitable and vain. A man that is an heretick after the\n      first and second admonition reject; Knowing that he that is such is\n      subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself. When I shall send\n      Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis:\n      for I have determined there to winter. Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos\n      on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them. And let\n      ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be\n      not unfruitful. All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us\n      in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.\n    </p>\n  </Book_layout>\n)\n\nexport default Titus\n","import React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\"\nimport \"../css/header.css\"\nimport { Link, withPrefix  } from \"gatsby\"\n\nconst Header = ({ book_title, dll_txt }) => {\n  var [light_mode, set_light_mode] = useState(true)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    var p = document.getElementsByTagName(\"p\")\n    var q = document.getElementsByTagName(\"q\")\n    var h1 = document.getElementsByTagName(\"h1\")[0]\n    var body = document.getElementsByTagName(\"body\")[0]\n    var svg = document.getElementsByTagName(\"svg\")\n    var nav = document.getElementsByClassName(\"nav_bar\")[0]\n    if (light_mode) {\n      nav.style.background = \"white\"\n      body.style.background = \"white\"\n      h1.style.color = \"#222\"\n      for (let v of p) {\n        v.style.color = \"#222\"\n      }\n      for (let v of q) {\n        v.style.color = \"#222\"\n        v.style.borderBottom = \"1px dotted #222\"\n      }\n      for (let v of svg) {\n        v.setAttribute(\"fill\", \"#222\")\n      }\n    } else {\n      nav.style.background = \"#212121\"\n      body.style.background = \"#212121\"\n      h1.style.color = \"#e0e0e0\"\n      for (let v of p) {\n        v.style.color = \"#e0e0e0\"\n      }\n      for (let v of q) {\n        v.style.color = \"#e0e0e0\"\n        v.style.borderBottom = \"1px dotted #e0e0e0\"\n      }\n      for (let v of svg) {\n        v.setAttribute(\"fill\", \"#e0e0e0\")\n      }\n    }\n  }, [light_mode])\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"nav_bar\">\n      <div className=\"nav_group\">\n        <Link to=\"/\">\n          <svg\n            width=\"1.5em\"\n            height=\"1.5em\"\n            viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\n            class=\"bi bi-house-door\"\n            fill=\"currentColor\"\n            xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n          >\n            <path\n              fill-rule=\"evenodd\"\n              d=\"M7.646 1.146a.5.5 0 0 1 .708 0l6 6a.5.5 0 0 1 .146.354v7a.5.5 0 0 1-.5.5H9.5a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5v-4H7v4a.5.5 0 0 1-.5.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5v-7a.5.5 0 0 1 .146-.354l6-6zM2.5 7.707V14H6v-4a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h3a.5.5 0 0 1 .5.5v4h3.5V7.707L8 2.207l-5.5 5.5z\"\n            />\n            <path\n              fill-rule=\"evenodd\"\n              d=\"M13 2.5V6l-2-2V2.5a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h1a.5.5 0 0 1 .5.5z\"\n            />\n          </svg>\n        </Link>\n      </div>\n      <h1>{book_title}</h1>\n\n      <div className=\"nav_group\">\n        <svg\n          onClick={() => set_light_mode(!light_mode)}\n          width=\"1.5em\"\n          height=\"1.5em\"\n          viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\n          className=\"bi bi-lightning\"\n          fill=\"currentColor\"\n          xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n        >\n          <path\n            fillRule=\"evenodd\"\n            d=\"M11.251.068a.5.5 0 0 1 .227.58L9.677 6.5H13a.5.5 0 0 1 .364.843l-8 8.5a.5.5 0 0 1-.842-.49L6.323 9.5H3a.5.5 0 0 1-.364-.843l8-8.5a.5.5 0 0 1 .615-.09zM4.157 8.5H7a.5.5 0 0 1 .478.647L6.11 13.59l5.732-6.09H9a.5.5 0 0 1-.478-.647L9.89 2.41 4.157 8.5z\"\n          />\n        </svg>\n\n        <a href={withPrefix(\"/\") + \"/bible_txt/\" + dll_txt} download={dll_txt}>\n          <svg\n            width=\"1.5em\"\n            height=\"1.5em\"\n            viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\n            class=\"bi bi-file-earmark-arrow-down\"\n            fill=\"currentColor\"\n            xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n          >\n            <path d=\"M4 0h5.5v1H4a1 1 0 0 0-1 1v12a1 1 0 0 0 1 1h8a1 1 0 0 0 1-1V4.5h1V14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V2a2 2 0 0 1 2-2z\" />\n            <path d=\"M9.5 3V0L14 4.5h-3A1.5 1.5 0 0 1 9.5 3z\" />\n            <path\n              fill-rule=\"evenodd\"\n              d=\"M8 6a.5.5 0 0 1 .5.5v3.793l1.146-1.147a.5.5 0 0 1 .708.708l-2 2a.5.5 0 0 1-.708 0l-2-2a.5.5 0 1 1 .708-.708L7.5 10.293V6.5A.5.5 0 0 1 8 6z\"\n            />\n          </svg>\n        </a>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Header\n","/**\n * Layout component that queries for data\n * with Gatsby's useStaticQuery component\n *\n * See: https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/use-static-query/\n */\n\nimport React from \"react\"\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\"\nimport Header from \"./header\"\nimport \"../css/book_layout.css\"\n\nconst Book_layout = ({ children, book_title, dll_txt }) => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"book\">\n      <Header dll_txt={dll_txt} book_title={book_title} />\n      <main>{children}</main>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nBook_layout.propTypes = {\n  children: PropTypes.node.isRequired,\n}\n\nexport default Book_layout\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
